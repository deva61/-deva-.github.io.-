      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Many people ask is God real or not? Does God exist? Is there evidence for God? What are the arguments for God’s existence? Is God alive or dead?.</p>
<p2>Maybe you’ve struggled with these questions in your mind. This is what this article is all about.</p2>
<p3>Interestingly, the Bible makes no argument for the existence of God. Instead, the Bible assumes God’s existence from the very first few words, “In the beginning, God…” The biblical writers did not feel a need, apparently, to offer arguments for the existence of God. To deny the existence of God is foolish (Psalm 14:1).

Yet, sadly, many in our day do deny the existence of God. Some deny his existence because they do not want to be accountable to God, and others because they have a difficult time understanding how God can exist and the world be so broken.

Even so, the Psalmist was right, theism is rational, and to deny God is not. In this post we will briefly visit many rational arguments for the existence of God.

</p3>
<h2 class = "title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Proof of God’s existence</h2>
<p4>There’s a name for this demonstration — natural theology, which is the science of demonstrating God’s existence using evidence and logic. Natural theology may be contrasted with revealed theology, which is the study of God via revelation in Scripture.

Natural theology has a massive history — it goes back at least to the ancient philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BCE) (the Prime Mover argument). A high point in natural theology was Thomas Aquinas’s Five Ways, which are scientific (i.e. evidence-based) arguments for God’s existence. In fact, the cornerstone of Aquinas’ metaphysics is that essence (what a thing is) is utterly distinct from existence (that a thing is).

Existence is not a property, in the sense that “Bob exists” is not the same kind of assertion as “Bob is 49 years old and has blue eyes.” Existence is prior to any and all categories. This sounds esoteric, but it has a profound implication: God’s existence is, and must be, provable via ordinary methods of science — by the pattern of evidence-logic-inference. God’s existence cannot be proven by mere logic or reason alone. You can’t prove that anything exists merely by logic. You cannot reason from pure essence (logic) to real existence (evidence). You can’t prove that the pyramids of Egypt exist merely by the Euclidean geometry of triangles. You can only prove the existence of actual pyramids by providing physical evidence for them.

Proof of God’s existence is and must be the same: it must be inferential—it must come from evidence. Natural science uses exactly the same inferential structure: evidence-logic-inference

Here’s a précis of the scientific argument for the Big Bang:

Galaxies show red shift, which is proportional to distance from the earth (evidence)
This implies that galaxies are moving away and, by inference, that the universe in the past was a single point (logic and Einstein’s tensor equations of gravitation (logic)
The universe began with a Big Bang singularity (conclusion)
Here’s Aquinas’ First Way:

Change exists in nature (evidence)
Change is the actuation of potentiality and an essential chain of actuations cannot go to infinite regress. A fully actual Prime Mover is necessary (logic)
That Prime Mover is what all men call God (conclusion)
Note that both scientific theories have the exact same structure:

Evidence from nature
Logical (or mathematical) framework
Inference to conclusion
Coyne acknowledges this identity but he doesn’t agree with the logical structure of Aquinas’ argument. Coyne argues: “There is no reason a chain of actuations cannot “go to infinite regress”. If there’s a multiverse, that’s more or less what you get. See Sean Carroll’s discussion below.” (Sean Carroll, “Does the Universe Need God?” )

Neither Coyne nor Carroll understand the argument — Aquinas’ argument has nothing to do with a multiverse and is valid whether or not a multiverse exists.</p4>
